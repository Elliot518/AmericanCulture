## 02 Grand Canyon National Park

<hr>
The Grand Canyon never fails to impress!
The Grand Canyon is vast and nearly incomprehensible in age,
it took six million years for the canyon to form, while some rocks exposed along its walls are two billion years old. 
Peer over the edge to confront the great power and mystery of the earth we live on. 
Once youâ€™ve seen it, no other natural phenomenon will quite compare.
