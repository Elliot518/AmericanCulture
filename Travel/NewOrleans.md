## 03 New Orleans

<hr>


While the rest of us eat to live, New Orleanians live to eat. 
The French, Spanish, Filipinos, Haitians, former Yugoslavians, Irish and Lord-knows-who-else have all contributed  here, making New Orleans one of the USA’s most food-centric cities. 
Sure, there’s unique history, gorgeous architecture and amazing music, but a visit here inevitably ends up being all about the food. 
For the true taste of N’awlins, eat with the locals in Riverbend, Uptown, Faubourg Marigny and the Bywater.
