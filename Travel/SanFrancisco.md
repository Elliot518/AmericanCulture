## 04 San Francisco

<hr>


Amid the clatter of old-fashioned trams and thick fog that sweeps in by night, the diverse neighborhoods of San Francisco invite long days of wandering, with indie shops, world-class restaurants and bohemian nightlife. If you can tear yourself away, the lush, rolling vineyards of Napa, Sonoma and the Russian River Valley lie just north of the city. Touring wineries, drinking great wine and lingering over farm-to-table meals – it’s all part of the great Wine Country experience.
