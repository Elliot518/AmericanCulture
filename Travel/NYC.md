## New York City

<hr>

Home to striving artists, hedge-fund moguls and immigrants from every corner of the globe, New York City is constantly reinventing itself. <br>
It remains a world center for fashion, theater, food, music, publishing, advertising and finance. <br>
A staggering number of museums, parks and ethnic neighborhoods are scattered through the five boroughs, so do as every New Yorker does: hit the streets. <br>
Every block reflects the character and history of this dizzying kaleidoscope, 
and on even a short walk here you can cross continents.
